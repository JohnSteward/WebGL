The scene will initially have the cube in the face rendering mode.
If you press 'e', it will change to the edge rendering mode
If you press 'v' it will change to the vertex rendering mode
If you press 't', it will change to the texture model for the cube.
If you press 'f', the cube will return to the face rendering mode.
Pressing 'x', 'y' or 'z' will rotate the cube about the x, y or z axis respectively. To stop rotation just press 'x', 'y' or 'z' again.
To move the camera, press 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'q', 'p' to move the camera up, left, down, right, forwards and backwards respectively.
To load the bunny model, press 'o'. You can then toggle the bunny's edge and vertex rendering modes by pressing 'o' again.
Rotating the bunny works the same way as it does for the cube
To play the animation, press 'c'.
